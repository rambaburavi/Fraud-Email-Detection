# Fraud Email Detection

This project uses machine learning to detect whether an email is **fraudulent or legitimate**. It trains a Random Forest model using TF-IDF features from email content.

---

## What It Does
- Cleans and prepares email text data.
- Converts text into numbers using **TF-IDF vectorizer**.
- Trains a **Random Forest classifier**.
- Can predict if a new email is a fraud or not.

---

## Files in the Project
- `train_email_detector.py` – Trains the model and saves it.
- `predict_email.py` – Predicts fraud using saved model.
- `model.pkl` – The trained model file.
- `vectorizer.pkl` – TF-IDF vectorizer file.
- `sample_input.txt` – Text file containing sample email for testing.
- `requirements.txt` – List of required libraries.

## How to Use

### 1. Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
### 2. Train the Model
python train_email_detector.py
### 3.Predict for New mail
